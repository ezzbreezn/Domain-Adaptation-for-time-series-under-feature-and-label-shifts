This project aims to explore and evaluate the performance of RAINCOAT, a novel domain adaptation method specifically designed to address feature shifts in time series data. RAINCOAT has demonstrated significant improvements over other domain adaptation methods, achieving up to 16.33% improvement in universal domain adaptation (UniDA) and 6.7% improvement in closed-set adaptation.

The project will systematically evaluate RAINCOAT against state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, replicate the experiments outlined in the original research [1] to assess the impact of RAINCOAT’s core components, and adapt it for environmental and geophysical modeling task. This task involves predicting future outcomes—such as earthquakes, floods, or species distributions—based on past climate data. The ultimate goal is to construct predictive maps for future scenarios using future climate variables, accounting for distribution shifts in patterns due to climate change and other factors.
